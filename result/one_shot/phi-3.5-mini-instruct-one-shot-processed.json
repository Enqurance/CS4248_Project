It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation, but DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.",

He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit, enabling catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity. Luther's catechisms, including the Small and Larger Catechism, used the German vernacular to express the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. This approach was effective for both parents teaching their children and pastors. Luther's catechisms were also understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and the Lord's Prayer, which are part of the Lutheran catechial teaching.",
